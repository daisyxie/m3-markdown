# Exercise-1

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

> “You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.”
